      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Butterfly Farmâ„¢ kits give you a front-row seat to a miracle of nature...the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. Watch the complete life cycle of the Monarch or Painted Lady butterfly unfold: egg, larvae, chrysalis, emergence, and the mating and egg-laying rituals. Witness caterpillars hatch from tiny eggs, molt several times, spin silk, pupate and transform into beautiful chrysalises. Discover amazing butterfly rituals, the Monarch caterpillar wiggling a Hawaiian hula as it slips into its jade-green chrysalis, the breathtaking slow dance of a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, a female Monarch laying her eggs on the bottom of milkweed leaves with the balancing act of a trapeze artist.</p>

      <p>These Monarch Rearing Kits contains fourteen to sixteen first to third instar monarch larvae (caterpillars) and rearing instructions. The larvae arrive in small cups and must be transferred to milkweed plants or leaves to feed.</p>

      <p>Please make sure you have fresh milkweed available before your caterpillars arrive. Each caterpillar generally needs 18 inches of milkweed to pupate. Pupation will occur in about 10 days and adults will emerge 10-14 days after pupation.</p>
